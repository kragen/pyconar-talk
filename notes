so my plan for my talk is to organize it around demos
(11:02:23 PM) kragen: I'll start with a really simple PyGame demo. like, the most interesting thing I can do in five lines of code
(11:02:54 PM) kragen: first display the demo, then display the code
(11:04:00 PM) kragen: then say, “And it can also do X!”
(11:04:25 PM) kragen: and add a couple of lines of code (ideally not by typing them while everyone waits) and show the results
(11:04:53 PM) kragen: and repeat that for, say, 20 or 30 minutes
(11:05:08 PM) kragen: interspersed with interrogating random audience members
(11:05:32 PM) kragen: “How do you think you would do Y in PyGame?"
(11:06:07 PM) kragen: then spend 5 or 10 minutes demonstrating more complete demos for which the code doesn't fit on the screen in a large font
(11:06:15 PM) kragen: and then ask for questions
(11:06:17 PM) kragen: what do you think?
