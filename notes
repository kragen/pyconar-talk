Stuff to cover:
- webcam input (not present in 1.8.1release)
- fullscreen output
- audio output
- NumPy (I have Numeric right now)
- 3D (PyOpenGL not installed currently)
- MPEG
- MIDI (not present in 1.8.1release)

I have 45 minutes.

Other people’s work?  Can't find any.

so my plan for my talk is to organize it around demos
(11:02:23 PM) kragen: I'll start with a really simple PyGame demo. like, the most interesting thing I can do in five lines of code
(11:02:54 PM) kragen: first display the demo, then display the code
(11:04:00 PM) kragen: then say, “And it can also do X!”
(11:04:25 PM) kragen: and add a couple of lines of code (ideally not by typing them while everyone waits) and show the results
(11:04:53 PM) kragen: and repeat that for, say, 20 or 30 minutes
(11:05:08 PM) kragen: interspersed with interrogating random audience members
(11:05:32 PM) kragen: “How do you think you would do Y in PyGame?"
(11:06:07 PM) kragen: then spend 5 or 10 minutes demonstrating more complete demos for which the code doesn't fit on the screen in a large font
(11:06:15 PM) kragen: and then ask for questions
(11:06:17 PM) kragen: what do you think?

Possible sequence:

- get up a window with something in it
- make it look cooler (add some alpha?)
- add some sound (a precanned thing, maybe with mixers)
- make it respond to the mouse somehow
- suck in some images and integrate them somehow (redisplay in a loop
  to animate them?)
- suck in an MPEG and draw it to the screen in place of the whole demo
  (this seems to not be working!? MPEG parsing errors? try a more
  recent pygame)
- change the MPEG to go to an offscreen surface and blit it in
  underneath other stuff
- replace the MPEG with input from the webcam
- do some kind of interesting computation with 

Possible demos:

- recumbent video
- recumbent software
- pygmusic (will I have speakers? Oh shit. I can hold the mic up to
  the laptop speakers I guess.)
- a Python version of paths.html (a lot of which is native in Python)
- rotating polygons
- klappquadrat
- a version of Artfall?
- some kind of harmonic synthesis?
- my wave-mechanics thing?
